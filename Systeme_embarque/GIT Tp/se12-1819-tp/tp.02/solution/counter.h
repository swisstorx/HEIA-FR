 * Abstract: Counter application
 *
 * Purpose: This module implements a counter [-99...99] over the 7-segment 
 *          display. According to rotations of the rotary encoder, the counter
 *          will be incremented (rotation to the right) or decremented 
 *          (rotation to the left). The LEDs of the 7-segment display will 
 *          be turn on/off according to the counter value.
